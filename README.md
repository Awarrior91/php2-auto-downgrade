This script aims to automate the installation of a Secure Node for ZenCash.

To run a Secure Node, you will need at least 2 Cores(/vCores) and 4GB RAM.

Before you run the script, you're going to need the current block height for the Net your Node will run in, which can be found at 

Testnet:
https://explorer-testnet.zen-solutions.io/

Mainnet:
https://explorer.zensystem.io/

You also need a fully qualified domain name.

Region Codes are:

eu for Europe

na for North America

sea for Southeast Asia


When you got those, run the script as follows:

./autoinst.sh -e YOUREMAILADDRESS -f DOMAINNAME -r REGIONCODE -b BLOCKHEIGHT
