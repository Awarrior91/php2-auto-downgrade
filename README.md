This script aims to automate the installation of a Secure Node for ZenCash.

To run a Secure Node, you will need at least 2 Cores(/vCores) and 4GB RAM.

You also need a fully qualified domain name.

Region Codes are:

eu for Europe

na for North America

sea for Southeast Asia


When you got those, run the script like this:

./autoinst.sh -e YOUREMAILADDRESS -f DOMAINNAME -r REGIONCODE
